# Resume File

To enable the resume download feature:

1. Create or obtain your resume in PDF format
2. Name it `resume.pdf`
3. Place it in the root directory of this repository
4. The download button will automatically work

Alternatively, you can update the resume path in `script.js` if you use a different filename or location.
